- **Login**: `POST /auth/login` - Log in and receive a JWT token.

### Admin Routes (require JWT with Admin role)

#### Category Management

- `PUT /admin/categories/:id` - Update an existing category.
- `DELETE /admin/categories/:id` - Delete a category.

#### News Management

### Authorization with JWT

Most routes are protected and require JWT authentication. To authorize:

1. Log in using valid credentials via `POST /auth/login`.
2. Use the JWT token received to authorize requests in Swagger (`/api-docs`) by clicking the "Authorize" button or in tools like Postman by adding an `Authorization` header with `Bearer <your_token>`.
